                    The Internet is the greatest technical human achievement of our era! But the <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/" target="_blank">Internet's health</a> is waning, and restoring it to it's fullest potential requires an informed netizenry. No single person or organization controls the Internet, it belongs to those who choose to get involved. We're hoping this project might expand your appreciation for our shared technical masterpiece and perhaps inspire you to help!
                </p>

                    When you "visit" a website, your computer (game console, laptop, smart phone, etc) is actually sending a request (a tiny file) across the planet! Initially that's over the air until it reaches the antenna of your router or cell tower and then over cables that connect computers all around the world together. Some of these cables lie underneath our streets while others span the ocean floors. Beaming across these cables at light speed, that request packet eventually reaches a server on another computer, before returning all the way back to your computer with the website (itself just another tiny file). In A Web Packet's Journey you play as that packet as it traverses the globe through the radio waves, cables and computers that make up the Internet.
